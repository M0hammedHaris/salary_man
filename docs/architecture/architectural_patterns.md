# Architectural Patterns

- **Jamstack Architecture:** Static generation with serverless APIs for optimal performance and scalability - _Rationale:_ Provides excellent user experience with fast loading while maintaining dynamic financial data capabilities
- **API-First Design:** All data operations through well-defined API contracts with TypeScript interfaces - _Rationale:_ Enables frontend/backend independence and future mobile app development
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract database operations through service layer with Drizzle ORM - _Rationale:_ Maintains clean separation between business logic and data persistence
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with React - _Rationale:_ Ensures accessibility and reliability for critical financial operations
- **Event-Driven Alerts:** Serverless functions triggered by data changes for proactive notifications - _Rationale:_ Enables real-time financial alerts without constant polling or complex infrastructure
- **Optimistic Updates:** UI updates immediately with server reconciliation - _Rationale:_ Provides responsive user experience while maintaining data consistency
- **Edge-First Deployment:** Leverage Vercel's global edge network for reduced latency - _Rationale:_ Critical for financial applications where response time impacts user trust and adoption

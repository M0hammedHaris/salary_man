## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.3 established the authentication system (Clerk), basic dashboard structure, and user interface components. The database schema builds upon the Clerk user authentication to provide secure data isolation and comprehensive financial data management capabilities.

### Database Technology Stack
**Database**: NeonDB PostgreSQL Latest for ACID compliance, modern PostgreSQL features, and serverless scaling optimized for financial applications [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM Latest for type-safe database operations with TypeScript integration, optimal for financial data precision and developer productivity [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Migration System**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations with version tracking and rollback capabilities [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

### Data Models and Schema Design
**Core Entities Implemented** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]:

**User Model**: 
- Primary key: Clerk user ID (text) for authentication integration
- Stores user preferences JSON including currency, date format, alert thresholds, notification settings
- Timestamps for creation and update tracking
- Unique email constraint for data integrity

**Account Model**:
- UUID primary key with foreign key to User
- Account type enum: checking, savings, investment, credit_card, other
- Balance with numeric(12,2) precision for financial accuracy
- Optional credit limit for credit card accounts
- Active status for soft deletion capability

**Transaction Model**:
- UUID primary key with user and account foreign keys
- Amount with numeric(12,2) precision (positive for income, negative for expenses)
- Transaction date separate from creation timestamp for user-specified dates
- Category foreign key with restrict policy to prevent accidental deletion
- Optional recurring payment linkage and receipt URL storage

**Category Model**:
- UUID primary key with user foreign key for customization
- Category type enum: income, expense
- Hierarchical structure with optional parent category
- Color coding for UI visualization
- Default category flag for system-provided vs user-created categories

**RecurringPayment Model**:
- UUID primary key with user and account foreign keys
- Payment frequency enum: weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
- Next due date for alert generation and automation
- Amount and category for automatic transaction processing

### Database Relationships and Constraints
**Foreign Key Relationships** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]:
- User → Accounts (one-to-many with cascade delete)
- User → Categories (one-to-many with cascade delete)  
- User → Transactions (one-to-many with cascade delete)
- User → RecurringPayments (one-to-many with cascade delete)
- Account → Transactions (one-to-many with cascade delete)
- Category → Transactions (one-to-many with restrict delete)
- Category → RecurringPayments (one-to-many with restrict delete)
- Category → Category (self-referencing for hierarchical structure)

**Data Validation Constraints**:
- NOT NULL constraints on all required fields
- Unique constraint on user email field
- Numeric precision (12,2) for all financial amounts ensuring decimal accuracy
- Default values for balance (0.00), active status (true), timestamps (now())
- Enum constraints for account_type, category_type, payment_frequency

### Database Configuration and Performance
**Connection Setup**: NeonDB PostgreSQL configured through DATABASE_URL environment variable with connection pooling for serverless architecture [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Primary key indexes on all tables (UUID with gen_random_uuid())
- Foreign key indexes automatically created for relationship queries
- Proper numeric precision to avoid floating point financial calculation errors
- Timestamp fields with timezone support for accurate financial record keeping

**Migration Management**: Drizzle Kit configuration with schema versioning, migration tracking through meta/_journal.json, and rollback capabilities for safe schema evolution [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

### File Locations
**Schema Definition**: `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Complete Drizzle schema with all tables, relationships, and TypeScript types
**Database Configuration**: `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle Kit configuration for migrations and schema management  
**Database Connection**: `src/lib/db/index.ts` - Database connection and client export
**Migration Files**: `drizzle/migrations/` - Generated SQL migration files with version tracking
**Seed Scripts**: `src/lib/db/seed.ts` and `scripts/seed-default-categories.sql` - Development and production seed data
**Repository Pattern**: `src/lib/db/repositories.ts` - Data access layer abstraction over direct database calls

### Technical Constraints
**Financial Precision**: All monetary amounts use numeric(12,2) PostgreSQL type to prevent floating point errors in financial calculations [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

**Data Security**: User data isolation enforced through foreign key relationships and proper cascade/restrict policies [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

**TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety through Drizzle ORM's TypeScript integration with inferred types for all database operations [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Migration Safety**: Strict mode enabled in Drizzle configuration to prevent dangerous schema changes in production [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Database Testing Strategy**:
- Schema validation through migration execution against test database
- Foreign key constraint testing to verify relationship integrity
- Data type validation for financial precision requirements
- Migration rollback testing for safe schema evolution
- Integration testing with repository pattern for data access validation

**Test File Locations**: Database schema tests should be placed in `src/__tests__/lib/db/` directory structure following established testing patterns from previous stories

### Project Structure Notes
Database schema integrates seamlessly with existing Next.js 15 App Router structure and Clerk authentication system. All financial data is properly isolated by userId from Clerk integration, ensuring secure multi-tenant data access. Repository pattern provides clean abstraction between business logic and data persistence layers.

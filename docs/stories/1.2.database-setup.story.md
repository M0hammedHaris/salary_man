## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 implemented Clerk authentication successfully. Database integration must work with existing Clerk user IDs and authentication patterns. User synchronization utilities from previous story provide foundation for database user management.

### Database Architecture
**Technology**: NeonDB PostgreSQL Latest for primary data storage [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
**Rationale**: ACID compliance for financial transactions, modern PostgreSQL features, serverless scaling [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Platform Integration**: NeonDB Multi-region with primary in US-East, integrated with Vercel deployment [Source: architecture/architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM Latest for type-safe database operations [Source: architecture/architecture.md]
**Rationale**: Type-safe database operations ensuring compile-time error detection for financial data operations [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

### Data Models
**Core Data Models** must implement the following schemas [Source: architecture/architecture.md]:

**User Model**:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string; // Clerk user ID
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}

interface UserPreferences {
  currency: string; // ISO currency code (default: 'USD')
  dateFormat: string; // Date display preference
  alertThresholds: {
    creditCard: number; // Credit utilization alert percentage
    lowBalance: number; // Low account balance threshold
  };
  notifications: {
    email: boolean;
    push: boolean;
    sms: boolean; // Future implementation
  };
}
```

**Account Model**:
```typescript
interface Account {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  type: AccountType;
  balance: Decimal; // Using decimal.js for financial precision
  creditLimit?: Decimal; // Optional for bank accounts
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum AccountType {
  CHECKING = 'checking',
  SAVINGS = 'savings',
  INVESTMENT = 'investment',
  CREDIT_CARD = 'credit_card',
  OTHER = 'other'
}
```

**Transaction Model**:
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  accountId: string;
  amount: Decimal; // Positive for income/credits, negative for expenses/debits
  description: string;
  categoryId: string;
  transactionDate: Date; // User-specified transaction date
  isRecurring: boolean;
  recurringPaymentId?: string; // Optional link to recurring payment
  receiptUrl?: string; // Optional receipt image URL
  createdAt: Date; // System creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Category Model**:
```typescript
interface Category {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  type: CategoryType;
  color: string; // Hex color code for UI consistency
  isDefault: boolean;
  parentId?: string; // For subcategories
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum CategoryType {
  INCOME = 'income',
  EXPENSE = 'expense'
}
```

**RecurringPayment Model**:
```typescript
interface RecurringPayment {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  accountId: string;
  name: string;
  amount: Decimal;
  frequency: PaymentFrequency;
  nextDueDate: Date;
  categoryId: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  lastProcessed?: Date; // Last time payment was detected/processed
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum PaymentFrequency {
  WEEKLY = 'weekly',
  MONTHLY = 'monthly',
  QUARTERLY = 'quarterly',
  YEARLY = 'yearly'
}
```

**Data Relationships**: 
- User has one-to-many with Accounts, Transactions, Categories, RecurringPayments
- Account has one-to-many with Transactions, RecurringPayments  
- Category has one-to-many with Transactions, RecurringPayments
- Category supports self-referencing for subcategories
- RecurringPayment generates multiple Transaction records over time
[Source: architecture/architecture.md#User Relationships, Account Relationships, etc.]

### API Specifications
**Database Security**: All database operations require proper user authentication and data isolation by userId [Source: architecture/architecture.md#REST API Specification]

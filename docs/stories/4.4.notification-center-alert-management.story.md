# Story 4.4: Notification Center & Alert Management

**Status:** Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a centralized location to manage all my financial alerts and notifications,
**so that** I can stay informed about important financial events and customize my notification preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Centralized notification center displaying all alerts organized by type and priority
2. Notification preferences panel allowing customization of alert types, timing, and delivery methods
3. Alert categorization with visual indicators for urgency (low, medium, high, critical)
4. Notification history with search and filtering capabilities for past alerts and actions taken
5. Bulk notification management with mark-as-read, archive, and delete functionality
6. Smart notification grouping to prevent notification overload while maintaining important alerts
7. Do-not-disturb mode with customizable quiet hours and emergency override options
8. Integration with mobile PWA capabilities for persistent push notifications across devices

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 4.1-4.3 have established comprehensive notification infrastructure including multi-channel notification systems (in-app, email, push), notification providers, alert center components, and notification services for credit card alerts, bill reminders, and recurring payments. The existing infrastructure includes `src/components/alerts/notification-provider.tsx`, `src/components/alerts/alert-center.tsx`, and service layers like `src/lib/services/bill-notification-service.ts` and `src/lib/services/recurring-payment-notification-service.ts`. The notification provider supports email, push, and in-app notifications with proper permission handling and preference management. Alert data models are established in the database schema with proper user isolation and categorization.

### Data Models
Based on the current database schema [Source: src/lib/db/schema.ts] and existing notification infrastructure:

**Existing Alert Infrastructure:** The `alerts` table provides core notification data:
- `id: uuid` - Unique alert identifier
- `userId: text` - Alert owner for user-scoped data
- `accountId: uuid` - Associated account for the alert
- `alertType: alertTypeEnum` - Alert type classification (credit_usage, bill_reminder, recurring_payment, etc.)
- `message: text` - Alert message content
- `currentValue: text` - Current measured value triggering the alert
- `thresholdValue: text` - Threshold that was exceeded
- `status: alertStatusEnum` - Alert status (triggered, acknowledged, dismissed)
- `createdAt: timestamp` - Alert creation time for history tracking
- `updatedAt: timestamp` - Last status change timestamp

**Notification Preferences Data Model:** Extension of existing user preferences:
- User notification preferences already exist in notification provider
- Per-alert-type notification channel preferences (email, push, in-app)
- Quiet hours configuration with timezone handling
- Emergency override settings for critical alerts
- Smart grouping preferences and thresholds

**Notification History Requirements:**
- Leverage existing `alerts` table for historical data
- Add notification delivery tracking (which channels were used)
- Bulk action tracking and audit trail
- Search and filtering by date range, alert type, and status

### API Specifications
Based on existing notification API patterns [Source: existing notification services]:

**Existing Notification Infrastructure:** Reuse and extend existing endpoints:
- Existing notification endpoints in `/api/notifications/` for sending notifications
- Notification preference endpoints for user settings
- Alert management endpoints for status updates

**New Notification Center API Endpoints:**
- **GET /api/notifications/center** - Retrieve all user notifications with filtering and pagination
- **POST /api/notifications/preferences** - Update comprehensive notification preferences
- **GET /api/notifications/preferences** - Get current notification preferences including quiet hours
- **POST /api/notifications/bulk-actions** - Perform bulk actions on multiple notifications
- **GET /api/notifications/history** - Get notification history with search and filtering
- **POST /api/notifications/quiet-hours** - Configure do-not-disturb settings
- **POST /api/notifications/test** - Send test notifications to verify delivery channels

### Component Specifications
Following existing component patterns and notification infrastructure [Source: src/components/alerts/ structure]:

**Notification Center Components:**
- `src/components/notifications/notification-center.tsx` - Main notification center dashboard
- `src/components/notifications/notification-preferences-panel.tsx` - Comprehensive preference management

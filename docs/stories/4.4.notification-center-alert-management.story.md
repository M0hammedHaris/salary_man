## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 4.1-4.3 have established comprehensive notification infrastructure including multi-channel notification systems (in-app, email, push), notification providers, alert center components, and notification services for credit card alerts, bill reminders, and recurring payments. The existing infrastructure includes `src/components/alerts/notification-provider.tsx`, `src/components/alerts/alert-center.tsx`, and service layers like `src/lib/services/bill-notification-service.ts` and `src/lib/services/recurring-payment-notification-service.ts`. The notification provider supports email, push, and in-app notifications with proper permission handling and preference management. Alert data models are established in the database schema with proper user isolation and categorization.

### Data Models
Based on the current database schema [Source: src/lib/db/schema.ts] and existing notification infrastructure:

**Existing Alert Infrastructure:** The `alerts` table provides core notification data:
- `id: uuid` - Unique alert identifier
- `userId: text` - Alert owner for user-scoped data
- `accountId: uuid` - Associated account for the alert
- `alertType: alertTypeEnum` - Alert type classification (credit_usage, bill_reminder, recurring_payment, etc.)
- `message: text` - Alert message content
- `currentValue: text` - Current measured value triggering the alert
- `thresholdValue: text` - Threshold that was exceeded
- `status: alertStatusEnum` - Alert status (triggered, acknowledged, dismissed)
- `createdAt: timestamp` - Alert creation time for history tracking
- `updatedAt: timestamp` - Last status change timestamp

**Notification Preferences Data Model:** Extension of existing user preferences:
- User notification preferences already exist in notification provider
- Per-alert-type notification channel preferences (email, push, in-app)
- Quiet hours configuration with timezone handling
- Emergency override settings for critical alerts
- Smart grouping preferences and thresholds

**Notification History Requirements:**
- Leverage existing `alerts` table for historical data
- Add notification delivery tracking (which channels were used)
- Bulk action tracking and audit trail
- Search and filtering by date range, alert type, and status

### API Specifications
Based on existing notification API patterns [Source: existing notification services]:

**Existing Notification Infrastructure:** Reuse and extend existing endpoints:
- Existing notification endpoints in `/api/notifications/` for sending notifications
- Notification preference endpoints for user settings
- Alert management endpoints for status updates

**New Notification Center API Endpoints:**
- **GET /api/notifications/center** - Retrieve all user notifications with filtering and pagination
- **POST /api/notifications/preferences** - Update comprehensive notification preferences
- **GET /api/notifications/preferences** - Get current notification preferences including quiet hours
- **POST /api/notifications/bulk-actions** - Perform bulk actions on multiple notifications
- **GET /api/notifications/history** - Get notification history with search and filtering
- **POST /api/notifications/quiet-hours** - Configure do-not-disturb settings
- **POST /api/notifications/test** - Send test notifications to verify delivery channels

Authentication via Clerk JWT tokens following existing pattern [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#api-specification]

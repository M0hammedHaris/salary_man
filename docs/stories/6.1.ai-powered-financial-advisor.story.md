## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 5.2 completed comprehensive savings goals and financial planning system with database schema, analytics service layer, API endpoints, and visualization components. The existing analytics infrastructure includes data aggregation methods for transaction analysis, account balance tracking, net worth calculations, and milestone tracking that can be leveraged for AI analysis. Previous stories established comprehensive financial data models including accounts, transactions, categories, savings goals, and user preferences that provide rich context for AI recommendations.

### Data Models
Based on current database schema [Source: src/lib/db/schema.ts and Story 5.2 implementation]:

**Existing AI-Ready Data Infrastructure:** Comprehensive financial data available through:
- `accounts` table with `balance`, `type`, `creditLimit` for financial health analysis
- `transactions` table with `amount`, `transactionDate`, `accountId`, `categoryId`, `userId` for spending pattern analysis
- `categories` table with `type`, `name`, `color` for transaction categorization insights
- `savings_goals` table with target amounts, deadlines, progress tracking for goal analysis
- `goal_milestones` and `goal_progress_history` tables for achievement pattern analysis
- `users` table with preferences including currency and notification settings
- Rich transaction history with categorization for spending pattern recognition

**Required AI Financial Advisor Data Structure:** New database tables needed:
- `ai_conversations` table for chat history, context persistence, and user interaction tracking
- `ai_insights` table for storing generated insights, recommendations, and their effectiveness
- `ai_user_preferences` table for AI personality settings, insight frequency, communication style
- `ai_learning_data` table for storing user feedback on recommendations and corrections
- `financial_health_scores` table for tracking calculated health metrics over time
- Integration with existing financial data for comprehensive analysis

### API Specifications
Based on existing REST API patterns [Source: docs/architecture/architecture_complete.md]:

**Existing API Infrastructure:** Standard REST endpoints with Clerk authentication:
- Authentication via Clerk JWT tokens in Bearer format
- Existing `/api/analytics/` endpoints for data aggregation and analysis
- Existing `/api/savings-goals/` endpoints for goal management and analytics
- Standard error handling and response formats established
- Database aggregation patterns for financial calculations

**Required AI Financial Advisor API Endpoints:**
- **POST /api/ai/chat** - Process natural language queries and provide AI responses
- **GET /api/ai/insights** - Retrieve personalized financial insights and recommendations
- **POST /api/ai/insights/feedback** - Record user feedback on AI recommendations
- **GET /api/ai/health-assessment** - Generate comprehensive financial health analysis

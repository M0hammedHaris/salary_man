# Story 4.1: Credit Card Usage Alerts

**Status:** ready

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to receive automated alerts when my credit card usage approaches preset thresholds,
**so that** I can avoid overspending and maintain healthy credit utilization ratios.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Automated alerts triggered when credit card usage reaches 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% of credit limit
2. Customizable alert thresholds per credit card with user-defined percentages and dollar amounts
3. Multiple notification channels: in-app notifications, email alerts, and browser push notifications
4. Alert history tracking showing all triggered alerts with timestamps and actions taken
5. Smart alert timing avoids spam by implementing minimum intervals between similar alerts
6. Visual dashboard indicators showing current utilization status with color-coded warnings
7. Alert acknowledgment system allowing users to dismiss or snooze notifications
8. Integration with transaction entry to trigger real-time alerts on new credit card transactions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.2 implemented enhanced transaction entry with currency conversion to INR and transaction categorization. The system now supports advanced transaction features including splitting, templates, and bulk entry. This story builds upon the existing transaction and account management foundation to add proactive financial monitoring.

### Data Models
Based on the current database schema [Source: src/lib/db/schema.ts]:

**Account Data Model:** Credit card accounts use the `accounts` table with:
- `type: 'credit_card'` to identify credit card accounts
- `balance: numeric` representing current balance (negative for credit cards indicating debt)
- `creditLimit: numeric` representing the credit limit for calculations
- `userId: text` for user association

**User Preferences:** The existing `UserPreferences` interface includes:
- `alertThresholds.creditCard: number` (currently defaulting to 80% threshold)
- `notifications.email: boolean`, `notifications.push: boolean` for notification preferences

**New Alert System Data Model Required:**
- Alert tracking table to store alert history
- Alert acknowledgment tracking
- Customizable threshold settings per account

### API Specifications
New API endpoints needed [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#api-specification]:

**GET /api/alerts** - Retrieve user's alert history and current status
**POST /api/alerts/settings** - Update alert threshold settings for specific accounts
**POST /api/alerts/acknowledge** - Mark alerts as acknowledged/dismissed
**GET /api/accounts/utilization** - Get current credit utilization data for dashboard

Authentication via Clerk JWT tokens following existing pattern [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#api-specification]

### Component Specifications
Following existing component patterns [Source: existing component structure]:

**Alert Dashboard Components:**
- `src/components/alerts/alert-center.tsx` - Main alert dashboard component
- `src/components/alerts/alert-settings.tsx` - Threshold configuration component
- `src/components/alerts/utilization-indicator.tsx` - Visual utilization display
- `src/components/alerts/alert-notification.tsx` - In-app notification component

**Integration Points:**
- Update `src/components/dashboard/account-balance-summary.tsx` to show utilization warnings
- Enhance `src/components/transactions/transaction-create-form.tsx` to trigger real-time alerts
- Add alert menu/indicator to main navigation layout

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Database schema updates: `src/lib/db/schema.ts`
- New migration: `drizzle/migrations/` for alert tables
- API routes: `src/app/api/alerts/` directory
- Alert services: `src/lib/services/alert-service.ts`
- Alert components: `src/components/alerts/` directory
- Alert utilities: `src/lib/utils/alert-utils.ts`

### Testing Requirements
Following existing testing patterns [Source: src/__tests__/ structure]:
- Unit tests: `src/__tests__/components/alerts/` for component testing
- API tests: `src/__tests__/api/alerts/` for endpoint testing
- Service tests: `src/__tests__/lib/services/alert-service.test.ts`
- Utility tests: `src/__tests__/lib/utils/alert-utils.test.ts`
- Integration tests for alert triggering workflows

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Use Drizzle ORM for database operations with type safety
- Follow Clerk authentication patterns for secured endpoints
- Use Zod for API request/response validation
- Implement using Next.js 15 App Router structure
- Utilize existing Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- Use Decimal.js or numeric precision for financial calculations
- Follow existing error handling and validation patterns

### Notification Implementation
[Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#platform-infrastructure]:
- **In-app notifications:** React state management with toast notifications using existing toast system
- **Email notifications:** Integration with Vercel's email capabilities or third-party service
- **Push notifications:** Browser push API for PWA capabilities mentioned in architecture
- **Cron jobs:** Utilize Vercel Cron Jobs for periodic alert checking

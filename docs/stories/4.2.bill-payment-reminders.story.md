# Story 4.2: Bill Payment Reminders

**Status:** Complete

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to receive timely reminders for credit card payments and other recurring bills,
**so that** I never miss payment due dates and avoid late fees or credit score impacts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Bill reminder system for credit card due dates with configurable advance notice (1, 3, 7, 14 days)
2. Recurring bill setup with custom frequencies (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual) and amounts
3. Multiple reminder notifications leading up to due dates with escalating urgency
4. Bill payment tracking with status updates (pending, paid, overdue) and payment history
5. Integration with account balances to warn about insufficient funds for upcoming bills
6. Customizable reminder preferences per bill type with different notification channels
7. Automatic reminder adjustment for weekends and holidays using business day calculations
8. Bill payment confirmation system allowing users to mark bills as paid directly from notifications

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 4.1 implemented comprehensive credit card usage alerts with multi-channel notification infrastructure (in-app, email, push notifications), alert service patterns for business logic encapsulation, and real-time integration with transaction processing. The alert infrastructure includes alert history tracking, acknowledgment systems, and dashboard integration patterns that can be leveraged for bill reminder functionality. The notification provider and alert center components provide established patterns for notification management.

### Data Models
Based on the current database schema [Source: src/lib/db/schema.ts]:

**Recurring Payments Data Model:** The `recurringPayments` table provides the foundation:
- `id: uuid` - Unique recurring payment identifier
- `userId: text` - Payment owner for user-scoped data
- `accountId: uuid` - Account charged for recurring payment
- `name: text` - Bill name (e.g., "Credit Card Payment", "Utilities")
- `amount: numeric` - Expected payment amount with financial precision
- `frequency: paymentFrequencyEnum` - Payment frequency (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- `nextDueDate: timestamp` - Next expected payment date for reminder calculations
- `categoryId: uuid` - Category for automatic transaction categorization
- `isActive: boolean` - Whether bill is still active
- `lastProcessed: timestamp` - Last time payment was detected/processed

**Existing Alert Infrastructure:** Reuse `alerts` and `alertSettings` tables:
- `alertType` enum needs extension for bill reminder types
- `alerts` table for tracking reminder notifications sent
- `alertSettings` table for per-bill reminder preferences

**New Bill Reminder Data Model Required:**
- Extension of `alertType` enum to include bill reminder types
- Bill reminder settings for customizable advance notice periods
- Bill payment status tracking (pending, paid, overdue)
- Holiday calendar integration for business day calculations

### API Specifications
New API endpoints needed [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#api-specification]:

**GET /api/bills** - Retrieve user's recurring bills and payment status
**POST /api/bills** - Create new recurring bill setup
**PUT /api/bills/[id]** - Update bill details and reminder preferences
**DELETE /api/bills/[id]** - Deactivate recurring bill
**POST /api/bills/[id]/mark-paid** - Mark bill as paid with payment confirmation
**GET /api/bills/reminders** - Get upcoming bill reminders and due dates
**POST /api/bills/reminders/settings** - Update reminder preferences per bill

Authentication via Clerk JWT tokens following existing pattern [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#api-specification]

### Component Specifications
Following existing component patterns and alert infrastructure [Source: src/components/alerts/ structure]:

**Bill Management Components:**
- `src/components/bills/bill-center.tsx` - Main bill management dashboard

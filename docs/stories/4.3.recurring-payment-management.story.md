## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 4.2 (Bill Payment Reminders) established comprehensive bill reminder infrastructure including multi-channel notification systems, bill service patterns, and automated cron job processing. The infrastructure includes the `recurringPayments` table foundation, notification provider components, and bill management API endpoints that provide the core data models and service patterns needed for recurring payment detection and automation. The existing BillService contains methods for bill payment detection and tracking that can be leveraged for recurring payment pattern analysis.

### Data Models
Based on the current database schema [Source: src/lib/db/schema.ts]:

**Existing Recurring Payments Foundation:** The `recurringPayments` table provides core infrastructure:
- `id: uuid` - Unique recurring payment identifier
- `userId: text` - Payment owner for user-scoped data
- `accountId: uuid` - Account charged for recurring payment
- `name: text` - Payment name (e.g., "Netflix Subscription", "Electric Bill")
- `amount: numeric` - Expected payment amount with financial precision
- `frequency: paymentFrequencyEnum` - Payment frequency (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- `nextDueDate: timestamp` - Next expected payment date for automation calculations
- `categoryId: uuid` - Category for automatic transaction categorization
- `isActive: boolean` - Whether recurring payment is still active
- `lastProcessed: timestamp` - Last time payment was detected/processed
- `status: billStatusEnum` - Payment status (pending, paid, overdue, cancelled)
- `paymentDate: timestamp` - Actual payment date when detected
- `reminderDays: text` - CSV of reminder advance days for notifications

**Transaction Pattern Analysis Requirements:**
- Leverage existing `transactions` table for pattern detection
- Analyze transaction history by amount, description, account, and date patterns
- Use transaction categorization for automatic recurring payment category assignment
- Integrate with existing transaction creation workflows

**Recurring Payment Detection Algorithm Data:**
- Transaction frequency analysis (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly patterns)
- Amount consistency thresholds for payment identification
- Merchant name pattern matching for subscription detection
- Date variance tolerance for irregular payment schedules

### API Specifications
Based on existing API patterns [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#api-specification]:

**Existing Infrastructure from Story 4.2:**
- **GET /api/bills** - Can be extended for recurring payment retrieval with filtering
- **POST /api/bills** - Can support recurring payment creation workflow
- **PUT /api/bills/[id]** - Pattern for recurring payment updates

**New Recurring Payment API Endpoints:**
- **GET /api/recurring-payments** - Retrieve user's recurring payments with filtering and analysis
- **POST /api/recurring-payments** - Create new recurring payment from manual setup or detected pattern
- **PUT /api/recurring-payments/[id]** - Update recurring payment details, frequency, and settings
- **DELETE /api/recurring-payments/[id]** - Cancel/deactivate recurring payment
- **POST /api/recurring-payments/detect** - Trigger recurring payment pattern detection from transaction history
- **GET /api/recurring-payments/analysis** - Get cost analysis and spending impact data
- **POST /api/recurring-payments/[id]/confirm** - Confirm detected pattern as actual recurring payment
- **GET /api/recurring-payments/missed** - Get missed or overdue recurring payments

Authentication via Clerk JWT tokens following existing pattern [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#api-specification]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 successfully implemented the complete database layer with NeonDB PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM. All database schemas, repositories, and financial precision utilities are available. User synchronization with Clerk authentication is operational. The repository pattern provides clean data access for dashboard components.

### Frontend Architecture
**Framework**: Next.js 15.4.6 with App Router for full-stack React framework including React Server Components, optimized bundling, and integrated API routes [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**UI Component System**: Shadcn UI Latest for accessible, customizable component system built on Radix UI primitives ensuring WCAG compliance for financial accessibility requirements [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**State Management**: React Server State + Zustand Latest - Server Components reduce client state needs, Zustand for complex client interactions [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 4.x for utility-first styling system with consistent design system, optimal bundle size, excellent developer experience [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

### Data Models
**Dashboard Data Sources**: All data models from Story 1.2 are available through repository pattern:
- **User Model**: Access user preferences for currency, date format, alert thresholds
- **Account Model**: Display account balances, types, and status with decimal precision
- **Transaction Model**: Show recent transactions with category information and dates
- **Category Model**: Provide category icons and color coding for transaction display
- **RecurringPayment Model**: Identify recurring payments in transaction list

**Data Relationships**: User has one-to-many with Accounts and Transactions. Transactions belong to Categories. All data properly isolated by userId for security [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

### API Specifications
**Data Fetching**: Use established repository pattern from Story 1.2 for type-safe database operations with Drizzle ORM [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

**Server Actions**: Next.js 15 Server Actions for form submissions and mutations, REST APIs for external integrations [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Database Security**: All database operations require proper user authentication and data isolation by userId from Clerk integration [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

### Component Specifications
**Dashboard Layout Structure** [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]:
- Financial health score card with trend indicator and tooltip explanation
- Account balance summary cards with color-coded status indicators (positive/negative/alert)
- Credit card utilization widget with visual progress bars and threshold warnings
- Recent transactions list (5 most recent) with category icons and quick-edit options
- Alert notification panel with priority-based visual hierarchy
- Quick action floating button for add transaction with context-sensitive options

**Responsive Design** [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]:
- Mobile: Single column stack with cards, Desktop: 3-column grid layout
- Breakpoints: Mobile (320px-767px), Tablet (768px-1023px), Desktop (1024px+)
- Progressive disclosure with expandable cards for detailed views
- Touch-friendly interaction targets on mobile devices

**Currency Handling**: Use decimal.js utilities from Story 1.2 for financial precision in amount fields and Intl NumberFormat + Custom Utils for money formatting and calculations [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Date Formatting**: date-fns Latest for date manipulation and formatting with comprehensive date utilities for financial calculations, timezone handling [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

### File Locations

**Utilities**: `src/lib/utils/` - Currency and date formatting utilities (existing from Story 1.2)
**Database Services**: `src/lib/db/repositories.ts` - Existing repository pattern for data access
**Types**: `src/lib/types/` - TypeScript interfaces for dashboard data structures

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Stack**:
- Frontend Testing: Vitest + Testing Library Latest for unit and integration testing with React component testing and TypeScript support [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
- E2E Testing: Playwright Latest for end-to-end user workflows with cross-browser testing for critical financial workflows [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Testing Approach**: Fast test execution, React component testing, TypeScript support, cross-browser testing for critical financial workflows [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Test Requirements**: 
- Unit tests for all dashboard components with proper mocking of data sources
- Integration tests for dashboard data loading and display accuracy
- Responsive behavior testing across different viewport sizes
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Loading state and error boundary testing

### Technical Constraints
**Framework Version**: Next.js 15.4.6 with API Routes for serverless endpoints and App Router structure [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
**TypeScript**: Version 5.x for type-safe frontend development preventing runtime errors in financial calculations [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
**Platform**: Vercel deployment with serverless functions and automatic deployment [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

**Performance Goals**: 
- Page Load: Initial dashboard load under 2 seconds on 3G connections [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]
- Interaction Response: UI feedback within 100ms for all user interactions [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]
- Animation FPS: Maintain 60fps for all animations and transitions [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]

**Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with proper heading hierarchy, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and adequate color contrast [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

### Project Structure Notes
Implementation should integrate with existing Next.js 15 App Router structure and leverage existing database layer from Story 1.2. Dashboard page should follow established authentication patterns from Story 1.1. All financial data should use decimal precision utilities created in Story 1.2.

### Testing
**Test Frameworks**: 
- Frontend Testing: Vitest + Testing Library for React component testing with TypeScript support [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
- E2E Testing: Playwright for end-to-end user workflows and cross-browser testing [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Test File Locations**: 
- Unit tests: `src/__tests__/components/dashboard/` (create this directory structure)
- Integration tests: `src/__tests__/app/dashboard/` (create this directory structure)
- E2E tests: Follow existing Playwright structure

**Specific Testing Requirements**: Test responsive behavior, accessibility compliance, financial data precision, loading states, error boundaries, and proper user data isolation

# Story 2.1: Bank Account Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** to create and manage multiple bank accounts with custom names and types,  
**so that** I can organize and track my finances across different financial institutions and account purposes.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Account list view displays all user accounts with current balances and account types
3. Account editing functionality allows users to modify account details except historical balance data
4. Account deletion with confirmation dialog and data integrity checks (prevent deletion if transactions exist)
5. Account type selection from predefined options with custom "other" option
6. Form validation ensures required fields and valid balance formats
7. Real-time balance updates when transactions are added or modified
8. Responsive design works across all device sizes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.4 established the complete foundation including Clerk authentication, database schema with Account table, and dashboard structure. The Account schema is already implemented with proper foreign key relationships, validation constraints, and TypeScript types. The database connection and repository pattern are established, providing the infrastructure needed for account management operations.

### Data Models and Schema
**Account Model** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]:
- Primary key: UUID with gen_random_uuid() for unique identification
- Foreign key to User via userId (Clerk user ID) for data isolation
- Account type enum: checking, savings, investment, credit_card, other
- Balance with numeric(12,2) precision for financial accuracy
- Optional credit limit for credit card accounts (null for bank accounts)
- Active status for soft deletion capability
- Timestamps for creation and update tracking

**Account TypeScript Interface** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]:
```typescript
interface Account {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  type: AccountType;
  balance: Decimal; // Using decimal.js for financial precision
  creditLimit?: Decimal; // Optional for bank accounts
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum AccountType {
  CHECKING = 'checking',
  SAVINGS = 'savings',
  INVESTMENT = 'investment',
  CREDIT_CARD = 'credit_card',
  OTHER = 'other'
}
```

### API Specifications
**REST API Endpoints** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]:
- GET /api/accounts - Retrieve all user accounts with Clerk authentication
- POST /api/accounts - Create new account with validation and initial balance
- PUT /api/accounts/[id] - Update account details with balance protection
- DELETE /api/accounts/[id] - Delete account with transaction dependency check

**Request/Response Schemas** [Source: architecture/architecture.md]:
```typescript
interface CreateAccountRequest {
  name: string;
  type: AccountType;
  balance: string; // Decimal as string for precision
  creditLimit?: string; // Optional for credit cards
  description?: string;
}

interface AccountResponse {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: AccountType;
  balance: string;
  creditLimit?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### Component Specifications
**UI Components** [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]:
- Shadcn UI components for forms, cards, buttons, and modals
- Tailwind CSS v4 for responsive design and consistent styling
- Form validation using Zod schemas matching API validation
- Currency formatting using Intl.NumberFormat for locale-appropriate display
- Loading states using Shadcn UI Skeleton components

**Form Components**:
- AccountCreateForm: Name input, type dropdown, balance input, description textarea
- AccountEditForm: Pre-populated fields with balance editing restrictions
- AccountDeleteDialog: Confirmation modal with transaction dependency warnings

**Display Components**:
- AccountList: Card-based layout showing all accounts with balances
- AccountCard: Individual account display with type icons and balance formatting
- EmptyAccountsState: Guidance for users with no accounts

### File Locations
**API Routes**: `src/app/api/accounts/` directory following Next.js App Router structure
- `src/app/api/accounts/route.ts` - GET and POST handlers
- `src/app/api/accounts/[id]/route.ts` - PUT and DELETE handlers

**Components**: `src/components/accounts/` directory
- `src/components/accounts/account-create-form.tsx`
- `src/components/accounts/account-list.tsx`
- `src/components/accounts/account-edit-form.tsx`
- `src/components/accounts/account-delete-dialog.tsx`

**Repository**: `src/lib/db/repositories/` directory
- `src/lib/db/repositories/account-repository.ts`

**Pages**: `src/app/accounts/` directory using App Router
- `src/app/accounts/page.tsx` - Main account management page
- `src/app/accounts/create/page.tsx` - Account creation page (if separate)

**Types**: `src/lib/types/` directory
- `src/lib/types/account.ts` - Account-related TypeScript interfaces

### Technical Constraints
**Financial Precision**: All monetary amounts must use numeric(12,2) PostgreSQL type and Decimal.js library to prevent floating point errors in financial calculations [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

**Data Security**: User data isolation enforced through Clerk userId foreign key relationships with proper validation [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

**API Validation**: All API routes must use Zod schemas for request/response validation ensuring type safety and data integrity [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Responsive Design**: Components must work across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Test Frameworks** [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]:
- Frontend Testing: Vitest + Testing Library for React component testing with TypeScript support
- Backend Testing: Vitest + Supertest for API endpoint testing and database integration tests
- E2E Testing: Playwright for end-to-end user workflows and cross-browser testing

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: `src/__tests__/components/accounts/` (create this directory structure)
- API tests: `src/__tests__/api/accounts/` (create this directory structure)
- Integration tests: `src/__tests__/lib/db/repositories/` (create this directory structure)
- E2E tests: Follow existing Playwright structure in root directory

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test account CRUD operations with proper user isolation
- Test form validation and error handling scenarios
- Test financial precision and currency formatting
- Test responsive behavior across different breakpoints
- Test accessibility compliance with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Test transaction dependency checks for account deletion
- Test balance calculation accuracy and real-time updates

### Project Structure Notes
Account management integrates with existing Next.js 15 App Router structure established in Story 1.1. Authentication is handled by existing Clerk middleware, and database operations use the established Drizzle ORM connection from Story 1.2. Account schema and types are already defined from Story 1.4 database foundation. Components should follow the established pattern from dashboard components created in Story 1.3.

### Architecture Patterns
**Repository Pattern**: Abstract database operations through AccountRepository service layer using Drizzle ORM for clean separation between business logic and data persistence [Source: architecture/architectural_patterns.md]

**API-First Design**: All data operations through well-defined API contracts with TypeScript interfaces enabling frontend/backend independence [Source: architecture/architectural_patterns.md]

**Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with server reconciliation for responsive user experience while maintaining data consistency [Source: architecture/architectural_patterns.md]

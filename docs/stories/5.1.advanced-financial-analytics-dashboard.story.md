# Story 5.1: Advanced Financial Analytics Dashboard

**Status:** Ready

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see comprehensive analytics of my financial data with interactive charts and trend analysis,
**so that** I can understand my financial patterns and make data-driven decisions about my spending and saving.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Interactive analytics dashboard with date range selectors (month, quarter, year, custom range)
2. Income vs. expense trend charts showing cash flow patterns over time
3. Spending breakdown by category with interactive pie charts and bar graphs
4. Account balance trends showing growth/decline patterns for all accounts
5. Credit card utilization trends with average utilization rates and peak usage periods
6. Month-over-month comparison widgets highlighting significant changes in spending patterns
7. Net worth calculation and tracking showing total assets minus liabilities over time
8. Responsive charts that work seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 4.4 established comprehensive notification infrastructure and enhanced alert center components with sophisticated notification management. The existing analytics-related infrastructure includes CostAnalysisDashboard component in recurring payments with basic chart functionality using Recharts library. The project already has Recharts 3.1.2 available for charting components.

### Data Models
Based on current database schema [Source: src/lib/db/schema.ts]:

**Existing Data Infrastructure:** Core financial data is available in:
- `transactions` table with `amount`, `transactionDate`, `categoryId`, `accountId`, and `userId` fields
- `accounts` table with `balance`, `type`, `creditLimit` for account-level analytics
- `categories` table with `type` (income/expense), `name`, `color` for categorized analysis
- `users` table with preferences including currency and alert thresholds
- Numeric precision is 12,2 for all financial amounts ensuring accurate calculations

**Analytics Data Requirements:**
- Transaction aggregation by date ranges (month, quarter, year)
- Category-based spending summaries with percentage breakdowns
- Account balance history tracking (derived from transaction history)
- Credit card utilization calculations (current balance vs credit limit)
- Net worth calculations (sum of all account balances minus credit card balances)
- Month-over-month comparison calculations from transaction data

### API Specifications
Based on existing REST API patterns [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#api-specification]:

**Existing API Infrastructure:** Standard REST endpoints with Clerk authentication:
- Authentication via Clerk JWT tokens in Bearer format
- Existing `/api/transactions` with filtering by accountId, categoryId, date ranges
- Existing `/api/accounts` for account data retrieval
- Standard error handling and response formats established

**Required Analytics API Endpoints:**
- **GET /api/analytics/overview** - Dashboard summary with date range filtering
- **GET /api/analytics/cash-flow** - Income vs expense trends over time periods
- **GET /api/analytics/spending-breakdown** - Category-based spending analysis
- **GET /api/analytics/account-trends** - Account balance trends and growth patterns
- **GET /api/analytics/credit-utilization** - Credit card usage analysis
- **GET /api/analytics/net-worth** - Net worth calculation and historical tracking
- **GET /api/analytics/comparisons** - Month-over-month and period comparisons

All endpoints follow existing authentication patterns with Clerk JWT tokens and include user-scoped data filtering.

### Component Specifications
Following existing component patterns and shadcn/ui structure [Source: src/components/ structure]:

**Analytics Dashboard Components:**
- `src/components/analytics/analytics-dashboard.tsx` - Main analytics dashboard layout
- `src/components/analytics/date-range-selector.tsx` - Interactive date filtering component
- `src/components/analytics/cash-flow-chart.tsx` - Income vs expense trend visualization

- `src/components/analytics/account-trends-chart.tsx` - Account balance trend lines
- `src/components/analytics/credit-utilization-chart.tsx` - Credit card usage visualization
- `src/components/analytics/net-worth-tracker.tsx` - Net worth calculation and display
- `src/components/analytics/comparison-widgets.tsx` - Month-over-month comparison components

**Chart Library Integration:**
- Use existing Recharts 3.1.2 for all chart components [Source: package.json]

- Utilize existing Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- Use Recharts 3.1.2 for chart components (already installed)
- Follow existing error handling and validation patterns
- Ensure responsive design works on both desktop and mobile devices

### Analytics Implementation Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/architectural_patterns.md and existing components]:
- **Data Aggregation:** Implement efficient database queries for time-based aggregations
- **Caching Strategy:** Use React Server Components for data fetching with proper caching
- **Real-time Updates:** Integrate with existing notification infrastructure for data refreshes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 4.4 established comprehensive notification infrastructure and enhanced alert center components with sophisticated notification management. The existing analytics-related infrastructure includes CostAnalysisDashboard component in recurring payments with basic chart functionality using Recharts library. The project already has Recharts 3.1.2 available for charting components.

### Data Models
Based on current database schema [Source: src/lib/db/schema.ts]:

**Existing Data Infrastructure:** Core financial data is available in:
- `transactions` table with `amount`, `transactionDate`, `categoryId`, `accountId`, and `userId` fields
- `accounts` table with `balance`, `type`, `creditLimit` for account-level analytics
- `categories` table with `type` (income/expense), `name`, `color` for categorized analysis
- `users` table with preferences including currency and alert thresholds
- Numeric precision is 12,2 for all financial amounts ensuring accurate calculations

**Analytics Data Requirements:**
- Transaction aggregation by date ranges (month, quarter, year)
- Category-based spending summaries with percentage breakdowns
- Account balance history tracking (derived from transaction history)
- Credit card utilization calculations (current balance vs credit limit)
- Net worth calculations (sum of all account balances minus credit card balances)
- Month-over-month comparison calculations from transaction data

### API Specifications
Based on existing REST API patterns [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md#api-specification]:

**Existing API Infrastructure:** Standard REST endpoints with Clerk authentication:
- Authentication via Clerk JWT tokens in Bearer format
- Existing `/api/transactions` with filtering by accountId, categoryId, date ranges
- Existing `/api/accounts` for account data retrieval
- Standard error handling and response formats established

**Required Analytics API Endpoints:**
- **GET /api/analytics/overview** - Dashboard summary with date range filtering
- **GET /api/analytics/cash-flow** - Income vs expense trends over time periods
- **GET /api/analytics/spending-breakdown** - Category-based spending analysis
- **GET /api/analytics/account-trends** - Account balance trends and growth patterns
- **GET /api/analytics/credit-utilization** - Credit card usage analysis
- **GET /api/analytics/net-worth** - Net worth calculation and historical tracking
- **GET /api/analytics/comparisons** - Month-over-month and period comparisons

All endpoints follow existing authentication patterns with Clerk JWT tokens and include user-scoped data filtering.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
*This section will be populated by the development agent during implementation*

### Debug Log References
- **React Server Components Error Fix (2025-01-13)**: Resolved Next.js 15 error where functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components. Issue was in ErrorBoundary component which expected a function component as fallback prop. Fixed by:
  1. Updated ErrorBoundary to accept ReactNode fallback instead of ComponentType
  2. Created separate AnalyticsErrorFallback client component with "use client" directive
  3. Updated analytics page to use the client component as fallback
  4. Error resolved: Analytics page now compiles successfully without React Server Components violations
- **TypeError Fix (2025-01-13)**: Resolved "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'find')" error in AnalyticsDashboard component. Issue was missing null checks for dashboardData.comparisons property when API calls failed. Fixed by:
  1. Added optional chaining (?.find()) for all comparisons access in overview cards
  2. Improved error handling with parseResponseSafely function to provide fallbacks for failed API calls  
  3. Enhanced robustness to handle individual API endpoint failures gracefully
  4. Error resolved: Analytics dashboard now loads successfully with proper error handling

- User data isolation with userId filtering in all database operations
- Input validation using Zod schemas for all API requests
- No SQL injection vectors (using Drizzle ORM parameterized queries)
- Proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Secure chart data handling without client-side financial data leakage

### Performance Considerations

✅ **EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**
- **Caching Strategy**: 5-minute TTL cache for analytics calculations reduces database load
- **Data Optimization**: Chart data sampling for large datasets (max 100 points)
- **Lazy Loading**: Pagination utilities for handling large transaction datasets

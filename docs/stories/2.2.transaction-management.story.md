The transaction management system will build upon this foundation, particularly:
- The authentication and user isolation patterns
- The repository pattern for database operations
- The API route structure and validation approach
- The UI component patterns and responsive design
- The testing strategies and frameworks

### Data Models and Schema
**Transaction Model** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- Primary key: UUID for unique identification
- Foreign keys to User (userId) and Account (accountId) for data isolation and relationship
- Amount with numeric(12,2) precision for financial accuracy (positive for income, negative for expenses)
- Description field for user-provided transaction details
- Foreign key to Category (categoryId) for organization and reporting
- Transaction date for when the transaction occurred
- Optional receipt URL for document storage
- Timestamps for creation and update tracking

**Transaction TypeScript Interface** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  accountId: string;
  amount: Decimal; // Positive for income/credits, negative for expenses/debits
  description: string;
  categoryId: string;
  transactionDate: Date; // User-specified transaction date
  isRecurring: boolean;
  recurringPaymentId?: string; // Optional link to recurring payment
  receiptUrl?: string; // Optional receipt image URL
  createdAt: Date; // System creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Category Model** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- Primary key: UUID for unique identification
- Foreign key to User (userId) for data isolation
- Name field for category display name
- Type enum for income or expense classification
- Color field for UI color coding
- Optional parent ID for hierarchical organization

**Category TypeScript Interface** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
```typescript
interface Category {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  type: CategoryType;
  color: string; // Hex color code for UI consistency
  isDefault: boolean;
  parentId?: string; // For subcategories
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum CategoryType {
  INCOME = 'income',
  EXPENSE = 'expense'
}
```

### API Specifications
**REST API Endpoints** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- GET /api/transactions - Retrieve all user transactions with filtering options
- POST /api/transactions - Create new transaction with validation and account balance update
- PUT /api/transactions/[id] - Update transaction details with account balance adjustment
- DELETE /api/transactions/[id] - Delete transaction with account balance correction

**Request/Response Schemas** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
```typescript
interface CreateTransactionRequest {
  accountId: string;
  amount: string; // Decimal as string for precision
  description: string;
  categoryId: string;
  transactionDate: string; // ISO date string
  receiptUrl?: string; // Optional receipt image URL
}

interface TransactionResponse {
  id: string;
  accountId: string;
  amount: string;
  description: string;
  categoryId: string;
  transactionDate: string; // ISO date string
  receiptUrl?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

interface GetTransactionsQuery {
  accountId?: string;
  categoryId?: string;
  startDate?: string; // ISO date string

### Technical Constraints
**Financial Precision**: All monetary amounts must use numeric(12,2) PostgreSQL type and Decimal.js library to prevent floating point errors in financial calculations [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

**Data Security**: User data isolation enforced through Clerk userId foreign key relationships with proper validation [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

**API Validation**: All API routes must use Zod schemas for request/response validation ensuring type safety and data integrity [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

**Responsive Design**: Components must work across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

**Account Balance Updates**: Transaction operations must trigger immediate account balance updates to maintain data consistency [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Test Frameworks** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- Frontend Testing: Vitest + Testing Library for React component testing with TypeScript support
- Backend Testing: Vitest + Supertest for API endpoint testing and database integration tests
- E2E Testing: Playwright for end-to-end user workflows and cross-browser testing

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: `src/__tests__/components/transactions/` (create this directory structure)
- API tests: `src/__tests__/api/transactions/` (create this directory structure)
- Integration tests: `src/__tests__/lib/db/repositories/` (create this directory structure)
- E2E tests: Follow existing Playwright structure in root directory

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test transaction CRUD operations with proper user isolation
- Test form validation and error handling scenarios
- Test financial precision and currency formatting
- Test responsive behavior across different breakpoints
- Test accessibility compliance with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Test account balance update accuracy and edge cases
- Test receipt upload and retrieval functionality
- Test category creation and assignment
- Test date filtering and sorting capabilities

### Project Structure Notes
Transaction management integrates with existing Next.js 15 App Router structure established in Story 1.1. Authentication is handled by existing Clerk middleware, and database operations use the established Drizzle ORM connection from Story 1.2. Transaction and Category schemas and types should be created following the patterns established in Story 1.4 database foundation. Components should follow the established pattern from dashboard components created in Story 1.3 and account management components created in Story 2.1.

### Architecture Patterns
**Repository Pattern**: Abstract database operations through TransactionRepository service layer using Drizzle ORM for clean separation between business logic and data persistence [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

**API-First Design**: All data operations through well-defined API contracts with TypeScript interfaces enabling frontend/backend independence [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

**Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with server reconciliation for responsive user experience while maintaining data consistency [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

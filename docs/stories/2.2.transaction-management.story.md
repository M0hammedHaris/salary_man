- Name field for category display name
- Type enum for income or expense classification
- Color field for UI color coding
- Optional parent ID for hierarchical organization

**Category TypeScript Interface** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
```typescript
interface Category {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  type: CategoryType;
  color: string; // Hex color code for UI consistency
  isDefault: boolean;
  parentId?: string; // For subcategories
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum CategoryType {
  INCOME = 'income',
  EXPENSE = 'expense'
}
```

### Project Structure Notes
Transaction management integrates with existing Next.js 15 App Router structure established in Story 1.1. Authentication is handled by existing Clerk middleware, and database operations use the established Drizzle ORM connection from Story 1.2. Transaction and Category schemas and types should be created following the patterns established in Story 1.4 database foundation. Components should follow the established pattern from dashboard components created in Story 1.3 and account management components created in Story 2.1.

### Architecture Patterns
**Repository Pattern**: Abstract database operations through TransactionRepository service layer using Drizzle ORM for clean separation between business logic and data persistence [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

**API-First Design**: All data operations through well-defined API contracts with TypeScript interfaces enabling frontend/backend independence [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

**Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with server reconciliation for responsive user experience while maintaining data consistency [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

### **🚨 CRITICAL NAVIGATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**MAJOR GAP: Missing Navigation Infrastructure**

The current implementation has **NO proper navigation system** between dashboard, transactions, accounts, and profile pages. This is a significant usability issue that needs immediate attention.

**Current Navigation State**:
- ❌ No main navigation header/sidebar
- ❌ Dashboard "View All Transactions" button is non-functional
- ❌ No direct way to navigate from dashboard to transactions page
- ❌ Users can only access `/transactions` by typing URL directly
- ❌ Profile page has no navigation breadcrumbs back to dashboard
- ✅ Accounts page has basic breadcrumb navigation (only working nav)
- ✅ Quick action button in dashboard includes "Manage Accounts" link

**Specific Issues Found**:

1. **Recent Transactions Component** (`src/components/dashboard/recent-transactions.tsx`):
   ```tsx
   {/* Lines 196-200 - Non-functional button */}
   <Button variant="ghost" className="w-full text-sm" size="sm">
     <span>View All Transactions</span>
     <ArrowRight className="h-4 w-4 ml-1" />
   </Button>
   ```
   **ISSUE**: Button has no `onClick` handler or `Link` wrapper - completely non-functional

2. **Missing Navigation Component**: No shared navigation header/sidebar component exists

3. **User Journey Broken**: Users cannot discover or navigate to the transaction management functionality

---

### **🔧 REQUIRED NAVIGATION FIXES**

**PRIORITY 1 - IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED**:

1. **Fix Recent Transactions "View All" Button**:
   ```tsx
   // CURRENT (broken):
   <Button variant="ghost" className="w-full text-sm" size="sm">
   
   // SHOULD BE:
   <Button variant="ghost" className="w-full text-sm" size="sm" asChild>
     <Link href="/transactions">
       <span>View All Transactions</span>
       <ArrowRight className="h-4 w-4 ml-1" />
     </Link>
   </Button>
   ```

2. **Add Navigation Header Component**:
   - Create `src/components/layout/navigation-header.tsx`
   - Include links to: Dashboard, Accounts, Transactions, Profile
   - Add to dashboard, transactions, accounts, and profile pages

3. **Update Quick Action Button**:
   - Add "View Transactions" action alongside existing "Manage Accounts"
   - Link add income/expense actions to transactions page with pre-filled forms

4. **Add Breadcrumb Navigation**:
   - Add breadcrumbs to transactions page: Dashboard > Transactions
   - Add breadcrumbs to profile page: Dashboard > Profile

**PRIORITY 2 - ENHANCEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**:

1. **Add Transaction Count to Dashboard**: Show transaction count in Recent Transactions header
2. **Deep Linking**: Allow direct navigation to transaction creation/editing from dashboard
3. **Mobile Navigation**: Consider hamburger menu for mobile navigation
4. **Active State Indicators**: Highlight current page in navigation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.2 (Transaction Management) QA review identified critical navigation gaps:
- Recent Transactions "View All Transactions" button is completely non-functional (no onClick or Link)
- No main navigation system exists between application sections
- Users can only access `/transactions` by typing URL directly
- Dashboard quick action buttons have console.log placeholders instead of actual navigation
- Profile page lacks breadcrumb navigation back to dashboard
- Only accounts page has working breadcrumb navigation

The navigation infrastructure is essential for user adoption and discoverability of the comprehensive transaction management functionality built in Story 2.2.

### Data Models and Navigation State
**Navigation Context** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
No specific navigation state management required - leverage Next.js built-in routing and pathname detection for active state management.

**User Authentication Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
Navigation must integrate with existing Clerk authentication system:
- Display user profile information in navigation header
- Include logout functionality through Clerk UserButton
- Protect navigation to authenticated routes using existing middleware

### Component Specifications
**Main Navigation Components** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- Use Shadcn UI components for consistent design: NavigationMenu, Button, DropdownMenu
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS breakpoint utilities
- Follow existing component patterns established in dashboard and transaction components

**Navigation Header Layout**:
```tsx
interface NavigationHeaderProps {
  currentPath: string;
  user: User; // From Clerk
}

// Navigation items configuration
const navigationItems = [
  { label: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard', icon: LayoutDashboard },
  { label: 'Accounts', href: '/accounts', icon: CreditCard },
  { label: 'Transactions', href: '/transactions', icon: Receipt },
  { label: 'Profile', href: '/profile', icon: User }
];
```

**Breadcrumb Component Structure**:
```tsx
interface BreadcrumbItem {
  label: string;
  href?: string;
  current?: boolean;
}

interface BreadcrumbNavigationProps {
  items: BreadcrumbItem[];
}
```

**Mobile Navigation Pattern**:
- Hamburger menu for mobile breakpoints (< 768px)
- Slide-out or collapsible navigation drawer
- Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44px)
- Proper z-index layering for overlay navigation

### File Locations
**Navigation Components**: `src/components/layout/` directory
- `src/components/layout/navigation-header.tsx` - Main navigation header
- `src/components/layout/breadcrumb-navigation.tsx` - Breadcrumb component
- `src/components/layout/mobile-navigation.tsx` - Mobile-specific navigation

**Layout Integration**: `src/app/layout.tsx` - Add NavigationHeader to root layout

**Updated Components**:
- `src/components/dashboard/recent-transactions.tsx` - Fix "View All Transactions" button
- `src/components/dashboard/quick-action-button.tsx` - Add transaction navigation actions

**Page Updates**:
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Add breadcrumb if needed
- `src/app/transactions/page.tsx` - Add breadcrumb navigation
- `src/app/profile/[[...profile]]/page.tsx` - Add breadcrumb navigation
- `src/app/accounts/page.tsx` - Verify breadcrumb consistency

### API Specifications
**No new API endpoints required** - Navigation uses existing authentication state from Clerk and static routing configuration.

**Deep Linking Support**:
- Support direct URL navigation to transaction creation with type parameter
- Example: `/transactions?action=create&type=income`
- Handle routing from dashboard quick actions to pre-filled transaction forms

### Technical Constraints
**Next.js App Router Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- Use Next.js Link component for client-side navigation
- Leverage usePathname hook for active page detection
- Maintain server-side rendering compatibility for navigation components

**Clerk Authentication Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- Use existing Clerk UserButton for profile dropdown functionality
- Maintain authentication state across navigation
- Ensure proper redirect handling for unauthenticated users

**Responsive Design Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- Navigation must work across desktop (>= 1024px), tablet (768px-1023px), mobile (< 768px)
- Use Tailwind CSS responsive utilities for breakpoint-specific styling
- Implement touch-friendly interactions for mobile devices

**Accessibility Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for navigation accessibility
- Implement proper ARIA labels and roles for navigation elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for navigation text and backgrounds

### Testing Requirements
**Component Testing** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- Unit tests using Vitest + Testing Library for navigation components
- Test active page highlighting logic with different route scenarios
- Test mobile navigation interactions and responsive behavior
- Mock Next.js router and Clerk authentication for isolated testing

**Integration Testing**:
- Test navigation flow between all application pages
- Verify breadcrumb generation for different route combinations
- Test deep linking functionality to transaction creation

**E2E Testing** [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]:
- Playwright tests for complete navigation workflows
- Test mobile navigation on different device sizes
- Test accessibility with automated accessibility testing tools
- Test navigation persistence across page refreshes and browser back/forward

**Accessibility Testing**:
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- Color contrast validation for navigation elements
- Focus management testing for mobile navigation

### Project Structure Notes
Navigation components integrate with existing Next.js 15 App Router structure and Shadcn UI component library established in Stories 1.1-2.2. The navigation system leverages existing authentication middleware from Clerk and maintains consistency with established design patterns from dashboard and transaction components.

### Architecture Patterns
**Component Composition Pattern**: Build navigation from smaller, reusable components (NavigationItem, UserDropdown, MobileToggle) for maintainability and testing [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

**Progressive Enhancement**: Core navigation works without JavaScript, enhanced with React interactions for better UX [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

**Responsive Design Pattern**: Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement for larger screens using Tailwind CSS breakpoint utilities [Source: docs/architecture/architecture.md]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No specific guidance found in architecture docs (this is the first story)

### Authentication Architecture
**Technology**: Clerk Latest version for user authentication and management [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
**Rationale**: Purpose-built for modern apps, supports MFA, session management, and user profiles [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Platform Integration**: Clerk integrated with Vercel deployment for authentication, user management, and session handling [Source: architecture/architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]

**Architectural Pattern**: API-First Design with all data operations through well-defined API contracts with TypeScript interfaces [Source: architecture/architectural_patterns.md]

### Data Models
**User Model Structure** [Source: architecture/architecture_complete.md#User]:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string; // Clerk user ID
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}

interface UserPreferences {
  currency: string; // ISO currency code (default: 'USD')
  dateFormat: string; // Date display preference
  alertThresholds: {
    creditCard: number; // Credit utilization alert percentage
    lowBalance: number; // Low account balance threshold
  };
  notifications: {
    email: boolean;
    push: boolean;
    sms: boolean; // Future implementation
  };
}
```

**User Relationships**: 
- One-to-many with Accounts (user can have multiple bank accounts and credit cards)
- One-to-many with Transactions (user owns all financial transactions)
- One-to-many with Categories (user creates custom expense/income categories)
- One-to-many with SavingsGoals (user can set multiple financial goals)
[Source: architecture/architecture_complete.md#User Relationships]

### API Specifications
**Authentication Security**: All API endpoints require ClerkAuth JWT bearer token authentication [Source: architecture/architecture_complete.md#REST API Specification]

**Middleware Integration**: Next.js middleware configured to work with Clerk authentication for route protection [Source: architecture/architecture.md#High Level Architecture Diagram]

### Component Specifications
**UI Framework**: Shadcn UI components built on Radix UI primitives ensuring WCAG compliance for financial accessibility requirements [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
**State Management**: React Server State + Zustand for Server state caching + client state management [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

### File Locations
**Project Structure**: Next.js 15 App Router structure must be maintained [Source: architecture/architecture.md#Architectural Constraints]
**Authentication Pages**: Should follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions for auth pages
**Middleware**: Configure in `middleware.ts` at project root for Clerk integration

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Stack**:
- Frontend Testing: Vitest + Testing Library for unit and integration testing with React component testing and TypeScript support [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
- E2E Testing: Playwright for end-to-end user workflows and cross-browser testing for critical financial workflows [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Testing Approach**: Fast test execution with React component testing, TypeScript support, and cross-browser testing for critical financial workflows [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

### Technical Constraints
**Framework Version**: Next.js 15.4.6 with App Router [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
**TypeScript**: Version 5.x for type-safe development preventing runtime errors in financial calculations [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
**Platform**: Vercel deployment with global edge network and automatic scaling [Source: architecture/architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]

**Security Requirements**: 
- ACID compliance for financial transactions [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
- Session management handled securely by Clerk [Source: architecture/architecture.md]
- Secure API boundaries with proper authentication [Source: architecture/architecture.md]

### Project Structure Notes
No specific project structure conflicts identified. Implementation should follow existing Next.js 15 App Router structure with Clerk integration patterns.

### Testing
**Test Frameworks**: 
- Unit/Integration: Vitest + Testing Library for fast test execution and React component testing [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]
- E2E: Playwright for cross-browser testing of critical authentication workflows [Source: architecture/tech_stack.md]

**Test File Locations**: Follow standard Next.js testing conventions with co-located test files
**Testing Standards**: TypeScript support required, focus on critical authentication workflows including sign-up, sign-in, logout, and profile management
**Specific Requirements**: Test MFA capabilities and protected route functionality to ensure financial data security

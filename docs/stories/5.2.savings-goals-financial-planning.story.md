## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 5.1 completed advanced financial analytics dashboard with comprehensive data analysis infrastructure including analytics service layer, API endpoints, and chart components using Recharts library. The analytics infrastructure includes data aggregation methods for transaction analysis, account balance tracking, and net worth calculations. Previous story established `/api/analytics/` API routes with proper Clerk authentication and database aggregation patterns that can be leveraged for goal tracking calculations.

### Data Models
Based on current database schema [Source: src/lib/db/schema.ts]:

**Existing Data Infrastructure:** Core financial data is available through:
- `accounts` table with `balance`, `type`, `creditLimit` for goal progress tracking
- `transactions` table with `amount`, `transactionDate`, `accountId`, `userId` for savings rate calculations
- `categories` table with `type`, `name`, `color` for goal categorization
- `users` table with preferences including currency and notification settings
- Numeric precision is 12,2 for all financial amounts ensuring accurate goal calculations

**Required Savings Goals Data Structure:** New database tables needed:
- `savings_goals` table with target amount, deadline, designated account, priority ranking
- `goal_milestones` table tracking 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% achievement events
- `goal_progress_history` table for historical tracking and projection calculations
- Goal categorization using existing categories system
- Integration with existing notification infrastructure from alerts system

### API Specifications
Based on existing REST API patterns [Source: docs/architecture/architecture_complete.md]:

**Existing API Infrastructure:** Standard REST endpoints with Clerk authentication:
- Authentication via Clerk JWT tokens in Bearer format
- Existing `/api/analytics/` endpoints for data aggregation and balance tracking
- Existing notification infrastructure through alerts system
- Standard error handling and response formats established

**Required Savings Goals API Endpoints:**
- **POST /api/savings-goals** - Create new savings goal with validation
- **GET /api/savings-goals** - List user's savings goals with progress calculations
- **PUT /api/savings-goals/[id]** - Update goal details (target amount, deadline, priority)
- **DELETE /api/savings-goals/[id]** - Delete savings goal
- **GET /api/savings-goals/[id]/progress** - Detailed progress tracking and projections
- **POST /api/savings-goals/[id]/milestones** - Record milestone achievements
- **GET /api/savings-goals/analytics** - Goal performance analytics and insights

All endpoints follow existing authentication patterns with Clerk JWT tokens and include user-scoped data filtering.

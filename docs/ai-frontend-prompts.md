## üéØ **Master Context Prompt** (Use this first for any session)

```
You are building SalaryMan, a comprehensive personal finance management web application. Here's the foundational context for all components:

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript 5.x
- React 19 with modern hooks and concurrent features
- Shadcn UI component library (latest version)
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Clerk for authentication

**Design System:**
- Color Palette: Primary #2563eb (Blue 600), Success #10b981 (Emerald 500), Warning #f59e0b (Amber 500), Error #ef4444 (Red 500)
- Typography: Inter font family with clear hierarchy
- Spacing: Tailwind's default scale emphasizing 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 unit values
- Mobile-first responsive design with breakpoints at 768px (tablet) and 1024px (desktop)

**User Personas:**
- Financial Management Professionals managing complex portfolios
- Multi-Account Power Users requiring granular control
- Budget-Conscious Planners focused on spending analysis

**Core Design Principles:**
1. Trust Through Transparency - All calculations include clear explanations
2. Progressive Disclosure - Complex features revealed contextually  
3. Intelligent Automation with User Control - Smart defaults, full customization
4. Clarity Over Complexity - Immediate comprehension prioritized
5. Proactive Assistance Without Overwhelm - Timely, appropriate alerts

The application centers on a dashboard-first approach with comprehensive financial tracking, automated alerts, and detailed analytics.

## üí∞ **Currency Display Component Prompt**

```
**High-Level Goal:** Create a reusable Currency Display component for consistent financial data presentation across SalaryMan with proper formatting, accessibility, and visual states.

**Detailed Instructions:**
1. Create a TypeScript React component named `CurrencyDisplay.tsx`
2. Accept props: `amount` (number), `variant` ('standard' | 'compact' | 'large' | 'trend'), `showSign` (boolean), `className` (optional string)
3. Implement proper INR currency formatting with commas for thousands and 2 decimal precision
4. For 'trend' variant, include directional arrow icons (‚Üë‚Üì) using Lucide React
5. Apply semantic color coding: green for positive values, red for negative, neutral gray for zero
6. Include proper ARIA labels for screen reader accessibility
7. Add loading skeleton state when amount is null/undefined
8. Handle edge cases: very large numbers, zero values, invalid inputs

**Code Examples & Constraints:**
```typescript
// Expected usage:
<CurrencyDisplay amount={1234.56} variant="standard" />
// Should render: $1,234.56

<CurrencyDisplay amount={-500} variant="trend" showSign />
// Should render: -$500 ‚Üì (in red)
```

Use Tailwind CSS classes only. Color classes should be: `text-emerald-500` (positive), `text-red-500` (negative), `text-slate-500` (neutral). Do NOT use custom CSS or styled-components.

**Strict Scope:** 
Create ONLY the `CurrencyDisplay.tsx` component file. Include proper TypeScript interfaces for props. Do NOT create any parent components or modify existing files.
```

   - Account Balance Summary showing total checking, savings, credit card balances
   - Credit Card Utilization widget with progress bars and color-coded warnings
   - Recent Transactions list (5 most recent) with category icons
   - Alert Notification panel with priority-based visual hierarchy
   - Floating Action Button for quick transaction entry
5. Use Shadcn UI Card, Badge, Progress, and Button components
6. Implement proper loading states with skeleton placeholders
7. Add hover/focus states with explanatory tooltips for financial calculations
8. Ensure WCAG AA accessibility with proper heading hierarchy (h1 for page title, h2 for sections)

**Code Examples & Constraints:**
```typescript
// Mock data structure for development:
const dashboardData = {
  financialHealth: { score: 85, trend: 'up' },
  accounts: {
    checking: 5420.50,
    savings: 12350.00,
    creditCards: -1200.30
  },
  recentTransactions: [
    { id: 1, amount: -45.67, description: 'Grocery Store', category: 'Food', date: '2025-08-10' }
  ],
  alerts: [
    { id: 1, type: 'warning', message: 'Credit card 70% utilized', priority: 'high' }
  ]
}
```

Color coding: Green for positive balances/trends, red for negative/alerts, amber for warnings. Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes.

**Strict Scope:**
Create ONLY the dashboard page file. Use mock data for now - do NOT implement API calls or authentication logic. Do NOT modify layout.tsx or create additional route files.

## üé® **Usage Instructions & Best Practices**

### **How to Use These Prompts:**

1. **Start with Master Context:** Always begin any AI session by providing the Master Context prompt first
2. **One Component at a Time:** Use individual component prompts separately - don't combine them
3. **Iterate and Refine:** Review AI output and refine with follow-up prompts as needed
4. **Test Thoroughly:** All generated code requires human review and testing

### **Optimization Tips:**

- **Mobile-First:** All prompts prioritize mobile experience then scale up
- **Accessibility Built-In:** Every component includes WCAG AA considerations
- **Type Safety:** All prompts specify TypeScript interfaces and proper typing
- **Design System Consistency:** Components use your established Shadcn UI + Tailwind foundation

### **Follow-Up Prompts:**
After generating components, you can refine with prompts like:
- "Add loading states to the [component name]"
- "Make the [component name] more accessible for screen readers"
- "Optimize [component name] for mobile touch interactions"
- "Add error handling to the [component name]"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Reminder**

**All AI-generated code requires careful human review, testing, and refinement to be considered production-ready.** These prompts provide excellent starting points, but you must:

- Review for security vulnerabilities
- Test across different devices and browsers  
- Validate accessibility compliance
- Ensure proper error handling
- Integrate with your actual APIs and data sources
- Perform thorough QA testing

The prompts are designed to give you 80% of the component structure - the remaining 20% of polish, integration, and production-readiness is your responsibility as the developer.

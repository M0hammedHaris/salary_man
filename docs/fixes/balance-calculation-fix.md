# Balance Calculation Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The account balance calculation was incorrect, showing ₹296,766.00 instead of the expected ₹75,883.00 for an account with only two income transactions.

## Root Cause
The balance calculation logic in the transaction repositories was incorrectly adding transaction amounts to the existing account balance (which already included previous transactions), causing a cumulative error.

### Original Problematic Code
```typescript
// INCORRECT - This would double-count previous transactions
const initialBalance = parseFloat(accountResult[0].balance);
const finalBalance = initialBalance + totalCredits + totalDebits;
```

### What Was Happening
1. Account starts with balance: ₹0.00
2. First transaction (₹3,383): ₹0 + ₹3,383 = ₹3,383 ✅
3. Second transaction (₹72,500): ₹3,383 + ₹3,383 + ₹72,500 = ₹79,266 ❌
4. Multiple updates could compound this error further.

## Solution
Modified the balance calculation to compute the balance purely from the sum of all transactions, without considering the stored account balance.

### Fixed Code
```typescript
// CORRECT - Calculate balance from transactions only
const finalBalance = totalCredits + totalDebits; // totalDebits is already negative
```

## Files Modified
1. `/src/lib/db/repositories.ts`
   - `createWithBalanceUpdate()` method
   - `updateWithBalanceUpdate()` method  
   - `deleteWithBalanceUpdate()` method
   - `calculateBalance()` method

## Database Fix Applied
Updated the incorrect balance in the database:
```sql
UPDATE accounts 
SET balance = (
  SELECT COALESCE(
    SUM(CASE WHEN t.amount > 0 THEN t.amount ELSE 0 END) + 
    SUM(CASE WHEN t.amount < 0 THEN t.amount ELSE 0 END), 0
  )
  FROM transactions t 
  WHERE t.account_id = accounts.id
), 
updated_at = NOW();
```

## Test Coverage
Added comprehensive tests to prevent regression:
- `balance-calculation-fix.test.ts` - Unit tests for balance calculation logic
- `balance-calculation-integration.test.ts` - Integration tests for real-world scenarios

## Verification
- **Before**: ₹296,766.00 (incorrect)
- **After**: ₹75,883.00 (correct: ₹3,383 + ₹72,500)

The fix ensures that:
1. Balance = Sum of all credits + Sum of all debits (debits are negative)
2. No double-counting of previous transactions
3. Accurate real-time balance updates
4. Consistency across all balance calculation methods

## Impact
- ✅ Account balances now display correctly
- ✅ Dashboard summary shows accurate totals
- ✅ Transaction creation/updates maintain balance accuracy
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ New regression tests prevent future issues

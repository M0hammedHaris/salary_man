# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a clean, trustworthy, and intuitive financial dashboard that reduces cognitive load while providing comprehensive visibility into users' financial health. The interface should feel professional yet approachable, with clear visual hierarchies that guide users naturally through their financial data without overwhelming them.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Dashboard-First Approach:** Primary interface centers on a comprehensive dashboard showing financial overview at-a-glance
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex features and detailed analytics are accessible but not immediately visible, reducing interface clutter
- **Smart Defaults with Customization:** System provides intelligent defaults for categories and accounts while allowing full user customization
- **Contextual Actions:** Relevant actions and options appear based on user context and data state
- **Guided Workflows:** Multi-step processes (like setting up accounts or credit cards) use wizard-style interfaces

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard:** Financial overview with key metrics, recent transactions, and alerts/notifications
- **Account Management:** View and manage all bank accounts and credit cards with balances and activity
- **Transaction Entry/History:** Add new transactions and browse/filter transaction history
- **Categories & Budget Management:** Configure custom categories and view spending by category
- **Analytics & Reports:** Charts, trends, and detailed financial reporting with export capabilities
- **Settings & Profile:** User preferences, account settings, and notification configuration
- **Alerts & Notifications Center:** Centralized view of all credit card alerts, bill reminders, and system notifications

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance including proper color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and semantic HTML structure. Financial data must be accessible to users with disabilities.

## Branding
Modern, professional financial interface with a focus on trust and clarity. Utilize Shadcn UI's design system for consistency, with a color palette that emphasizes financial themes (greens for positive, reds for alerts/negative, blues for neutral information). Clean typography and ample whitespace to reduce visual stress when dealing with financial data.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on responsive web application optimized for desktop financial management while maintaining full functionality on mobile devices. Interface adapts gracefully from desktop dashboard layouts to mobile-first card-based interfaces.

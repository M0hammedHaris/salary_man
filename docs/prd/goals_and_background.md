## Background Context

SalaryMan addresses the growing need for comprehensive personal finance management in an increasingly complex financial landscape. With many individuals managing multiple bank accounts, credit cards, and various recurring payments, traditional budgeting tools often fall short of providing the granular tracking and automation needed for effective financial management.

The current market lacks a unified solution that combines expense tracking with proactive credit card management, automated recurring payment oversight, and detailed analytics. SalaryMan fills this gap by providing a modern, full-stack solution that not only tracks financial activities but also helps prevent costly mistakes through intelligent alerts and reminders, particularly around credit card usage and payment due dates.

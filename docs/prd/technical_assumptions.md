# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all application components (frontend, backend API routes, database schemas, shared utilities) leveraging Next.js full-stack capabilities. This approach simplifies development workflow and deployment while maintaining clear separation of concerns within the codebase.

## Service Architecture
**Monolith with API Routes:** Leverage Next.js 15 App Router with API routes for backend functionality, utilizing serverless functions for scalability. Database operations handled through Drizzle ORM with NeonDB PostgreSQL. This architecture provides optimal development velocity while supporting future microservices extraction if needed.

## Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing:** Implement comprehensive testing strategy including:
- Unit tests for utility functions and business logic
- Integration tests for API routes and database operations
- Component testing for React components using Jest and React Testing Library
- End-to-end testing for critical user workflows using Playwright
- Database testing with in-memory test databases for isolation

## Framework & Libraries
- **Next.js 15** with App Router for modern React development patterns and latest performance optimizations
- **React 19** for latest React features and concurrent rendering improvements
- **Shadcn UI (latest)** + **Tailwind CSS v4** for consistent, accessible component library with latest design tokens
- **Drizzle ORM (latest)** for type-safe database operations and migrations
- **Clerk (latest)** for authentication and user management with built-in security features

## Database & Data Management
- **NeonDB PostgreSQL (latest)** for primary data storage with automatic backups and serverless scaling
- **Drizzle migrations** for version-controlled database schema changes
- **Zod (latest)** for data validation and type safety across client/server boundary
- **Connection pooling** for optimal database performance

## Development & Deployment
- **TypeScript 5.x** throughout the application for latest type safety features and developer experience
- **ESLint 9.x + Prettier (latest)** for code quality and consistency
- **Vercel deployment** with latest edge runtime optimizations
- **Environment-based configuration** for development, staging, and production environments

## Security & Privacy
- **Clerk security features** including multi-factor authentication options with latest security protocols
- **HTTPS enforcement** for all client-server communication
- **Input sanitization** and SQL injection prevention through ORM usage
- **Rate limiting** on API endpoints to prevent abuse
- **Secure session management** handled by Clerk infrastructure

## Performance & Monitoring
- **Next.js 15 built-in optimizations** including latest image optimization, code splitting, and server components
- **Database query optimization** with proper indexing strategy
- **Error tracking** and performance monitoring integration
- **Caching strategy** leveraging Next.js 15's enhanced caching mechanisms for frequently accessed financial data

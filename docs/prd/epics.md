# Epic List

Based on the requirements and following agile best practices, I've structured the development into logically sequential epics that each deliver significant, end-to-end functionality:

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
Establish project setup, authentication system, and basic dashboard framework while delivering a functional health-check and user onboarding flow.

## Epic 2: Account & Transaction Management
Enable users to create and manage bank accounts and credit cards, with basic transaction entry and viewing capabilities.

## Epic 3: Financial Tracking & Categorization
Implement comprehensive expense/income tracking, custom categories, and transaction history with filtering and search.

## Epic 4: Smart Alerts & Automation
Deliver proactive credit card usage alerts, bill reminders, and recurring payment management to prevent financial missteps.

## Epic 5: Analytics & Reporting Dashboard
Provide comprehensive financial analytics, trends visualization, savings goal tracking, and data export capabilities.
